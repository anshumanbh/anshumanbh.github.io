<p>If you need any sort of application level encryption while using Google PubSub as a distributed messaging queue, it is not obvious on how to implement it because there is no documentation from Google that I could find around the exact same thing. There was some code but I had to make sense of it and combine a few other things to get it working finally.</p>
<p>I was able to implement it using Google Cloud KMS and it was pretty easy to do so. So, here goes..</p>
<p>You would need a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts">service account</a> in order to get this working. Next, copy paste the below two files locally:</p>
<ul>
<li>testtopic.py - https://gist.github.com/anshumanbh/d60d1600f06e501f83fb01055b8d5e5c</li>
<li>testsub.py - https://gist.github.com/anshumanbh/f48dc1d9d8b2158252f716a3719bf8e6</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you have all the libraries installed like gcloud to run these python files. Also, replace the variables that are marked as "&lt;&gt;" as per your GCloud environment. You would need a project_id, location, keyring, cryptokey, testtopic and testsub. testsub would be the subscription for the testtopic.</p>
<p>You would also need to add "Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter" permissions for your service account by navigating to IAM&amp;Admin -&gt; Key Management in the Console.</p>
<p>Now, when you run python testtopic.py, that file basically encrypts a json - {test:"test"} and drops it in the testtopic.</p>
<p>Next, when you run python testsub.py, that file subscribes to testsub that is a subscription for testtopic. It then pulls the data and gets the encrypted data. It then uses the KMS API with the service account credentials to decrypt the message.</p>
<p>Thus, anybody who is able to grab the messages from the PubSub topic cannot really decrypt any messages because they wouldn't be authorized to do so! Simple and easy..</p>
